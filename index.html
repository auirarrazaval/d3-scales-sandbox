            A D3.js scale type playground
        </h1>
        <h3>
            The goal for this tool is to show how different D3.js scales look and help represent different data,
            as well as to show how the transition between them can be achieved in a smooth and entertaining way.
        </h3>
        <p>
            To build this tool, dummy data was generated using different distributions. The goal is for the user to be able
            to compare dynamically each data entry and figure out both what type of distribution each variable follows,
            as well as find relationships or correlations between the different variables that are presented
        </p>
        <p>
            Because some scales become undefined for some values (exponential and negatives, for example), the data join is also reflected in the tool,
            where dots that are re-incorporated after being taken out have a purple color, and "old" nodes have a blue color
